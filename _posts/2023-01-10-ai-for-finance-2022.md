**At the AI for Finance Summit on September 20th, 2022, we presented our AI Monitoring system, designed to help maintain control over AI systems and ensure their trustworthiness. During the summit, Aldrick ZAPPELLINI, Walid ERRAY, and Mathieu CAPRON highlighted the importance of monitoring in the deployment of AI in the finance industry and how our monitoring system can ensure the trustworthiness and long-term performance of AI solutions.**

Our focus on monitoring AI systems is driven by our commitment to ensuring the long-term performance and reliability of AI solutions. In many cases, AI monitoring systems are given less priority than other aspects of AI solutions leading to issues and malfunctions. To address this, the DataLab Group developed an in-house platform that allows complete monitoring of both data and model drifts across all the Group's entities. Our ultimate goal is to ensure a trustworthy adoption of AI, and monitoring AI systems is a critical step towards achieving this goal.

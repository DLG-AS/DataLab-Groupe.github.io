**The DataLab Group participated in the Innovation Show by CA event, the annual innovation fair hosted by Credit Agricole. We showcased some of our projects and delivered in-depth presentations about our ongoing work.**

During the event, Emeric Tonnelier and Matthieu Capron presented our cybersecurity projects and explained how we utilize AI to detect potential alerts and breaches. Lea Fromentin and Ghassen Bettaieb showcased our latest information extraction generation solution. Thomas Capdevielle demonstrated his use of multiple data sources to predict the optimal locations for installing new charging points based on urban activity. We would like to express our gratitude to all attendees for sharing their work and engaging in valuable interactions with us.

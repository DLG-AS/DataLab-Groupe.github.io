**At the AI for Finance Summit on September 14th, 2023, we presented our Intelligent Document Processing plateform. During the summit, Aldrick ZAPPELLINI, Aymen SHABOU, and LÃ©a FROMENTIN highlighted the importance of designing innovative, industrial, trustworthy and responsible AI systems for the Credit Agricole Group, in particular to deal with customer documents**

The DataLab Group of Credit Agricole presented its work on documentary AI at the AIforfinance summit. Powerful, fast, and efficient, built internally using a certified and labeled methodology, these developments are part of an approach that combines innovation and anticipation of future AI Act regulations.
Too often seen as opposing concepts, combining trustworthy and responsible AI with innovation is possible and will be the future of AI development.

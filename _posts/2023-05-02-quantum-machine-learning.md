**As quantum computing is acquiring momentum, opportunities of use cases in
artificial intelligence, discrete optimization and cybersecurity are emerging
especially in the banking industry. With the goal of staying on the bloody edge
of technology in mind, the DataLab Group organized a 6 days training in January
and February. The training was organized with PASQAL and invited multiple
members from various parts of the group to discuss quantum computing and how it
can apply to machine learning. The training explored theoretical and practical
aspects with quantum algorithms implementation.**

# Implementing quantum approaches in the digital transformation

We have known for a long time that quantum computing can theoretically
solve complex problems easier than classical computing. With the refinement
of more and more powerful quantum computers, it starts becoming realistic
to implement real life use cases on those machines. For example, by using N
qubits, it is possible to encode 2^N classical bits and the Osprey processor
from IBM now has 443 qubits which in some cases can overcome the abilities
of existing classical computers.

We know that quantum approaches are especially adapted to optimisation
problems and machine learning. With the goal to stay on the bloody edge of
innovation, the DataLab Groupe wishes to contribute to researh on quantum
machine learning. We want to inspire new real life use cases and new
methods allowing us to deal with data more efficiently or faster. Quantum
based neural networks approaches do exist in the litterature and it is
important for us to have an expertise on the field in order to select the
technologies which fit the best in our group.

# Use cases related to the NISQ

If a big part of the quantum computing algorithms remain in the realm
of fiction as Schör's algorithm for finding private keys in RSA, other
use cases corresponding to the NISQ (Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum)
are now implementable and used. The NISQ era is the time of quantum
computers with 50 to 100 noisy qubits. If that noise prevents
the implementation of Schör's algorithm, it allows implementation of
other approaches such as QAOA (Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm),
an algorithm which performs discrete optimization, a task which is
difficult for classical computers. That's why we focused a lot on NISQ
approaches and on analog strategies as those can be implemented now.

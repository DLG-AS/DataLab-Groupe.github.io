**From December 5 to 9, a team of 4 Data Scientists from the DataLab Groupe (ITD) participated in an international challenge, jointly organized by the NGO The Ocean Cleanup and the companies Kili, Weights & Biases and OVHcloud. The objective is to contribute to the development of Artificial Intelligence systems to fight against plastic pollution in the marine environment. The DataLab Groupe team is on the podium among 300 other teams from companies and laboratories worldwide.**

Plastic pollution in the marine environment is a global threat to the health of marine species, human health, food safety, coastal tourism, etc. Indeed, **among the 350 million tons of plastic produced each year**, it is estimated that **more than 15 million tons end up in the ocean**.

The fight against this type of pollution is one of Crédit Agricole's commitments with, for example, the [Plastic Odyssey](https://plasticodyssey.org/) initiative, of which the Group has been a partner since the project's prototyping phase in 2018.

**Artificial intelligence** can play an important role by helping to spot plastic waste more quickly from images taken on boats, for example.

Thus, between December 5 and 9, an [international challenge](https://resources.kili-technology.com/the-ocean-cleanup-challenge-3) was jointly organized by the NGO The Ocean Cleanup and the companies Kili, Weights & Biases and OVHcloud. It brought together 300 teams from companies and research laboratories around the world. The objective was to create a reference dataset for learning and testing models for detecting plastic waste in the open ocean. The photographs were taken on The Ocean Cleanup’s boats.

The challenge consisted of two independent tasks to detect plastic waste objects in a dataset of over 180,000 images:

* Task 1: manual/semi-manual annotation;
* Task 2: annotation model's accuracy.

After evaluating each team's contribution, organizers revealed that the DataLab Groupe team won 2nd and 3rd place respectively on these [two tasks](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/kili-technology_the-ocean-cleanup-challenge-winners-reveal-activity-7008479536094789632-5ERd).


# What is the DataLab Groupe's recipe?
Thanks to the implementation of an **active learning** process, consisting in building an AI model trained on the most relevant images, iteratively selected and labeled manually to characterize the presence or absence of the sought objects, **the team was the only one to make its place on the podium of both tasks**.

A big congratulations to this winning team:
* Aghiles Azzoug
* Achraf Saghe
* Paul Wassermann
* Saif Fares

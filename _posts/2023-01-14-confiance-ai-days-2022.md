**On October 5th and 6th, 2022, data scientists from the DataLab Group participated in Confiance.AI Days, an event focused on promoting responsible AI. During the event, researchers and Data&AI  experts presented  posters showcasing their work towards responsible use of AI. Timothée Fronteau and Arnaud PARAN, from the DataLab Group, presented their research on adversarial attacks. Trying to understand the threat that adversarial attacks pose to the multiple models used in document processing and trying to make models robust to those attacks. In that work, we displayed the fact that similar to natural images, documents are sensitive to adversarial attacks, but adversarial training can lead to robust generalization.**

The displayed poster  explains the process that we went through during the experiments in order to prove the obtained results

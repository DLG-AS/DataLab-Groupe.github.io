**Two new papers have been accepted in The 17th International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition. Authors of the first paper, Mohamed DHOUIB, Ghassen BETTAIEB and Aymen SHABOU, propose an efficient ocr-free approach for information extraction from scanned documents. Authors of the second paper, Timoth√© FRONTEAU, Arnaud PARAN and Aymen SHABOU, propose a first attempt to study adversarial attacks on the document classification task. These papers will be presented by Mohamed DHOUIB and Arnaud PARAN soon, on August 21th**

Paper 1: [DocParser: End-to-end OCR-free Information Extraction from Visually Rich Documents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12484)

Paper 2: [Evaluating Adversarial Robustness on Document Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12486)

Inside of the innovation center of Crédit Agricole S.A., the DataLab Groupe
Crédit Agricole is a technological hotspot dedicated to data science and
its applications in the banking sector. Its mission is to create new and
innovating approaches in order to take advantage of internal or external

Among its missions, many scientific themes with high added value are explored
and those activities take place with participation of our partners inside of
the group.

<p>

We highly value <b>responsible</b> and <b>industrial</b> data and we apply the best
practices of the field regarding <b>evaluation, MLOps, monitoring, AI
as-a-service, explainable ai</b> and many other topics. We have expert Data
Engineers and Data Scientists who make sure that our industrial AI standards
are applied through the whole life of our projects.

One of our missions is to keep doing <b>research</b> so that we can implement the
state of the art and be in position to participate to scientific innovation.
For achieving that goal, we have many R&D projects which try to implement the
SOTA to real life use cases.
